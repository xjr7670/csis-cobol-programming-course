# csis-cobol-programming-course
A documentation backup of University of Limerick's Cobol programming course by Michael Coughlan

The original location is [COBOL Programming Course](https://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/course/Default.htm).

All pdf files are converted by Chrome browser.

The animation files attached within each course is originally the `ppz` format, which is within the **Origin-ppt** directory. PPZ file cannot open with a modern Microsoft's powerpoint software, so I'd convert them to the openable file, that is, the `ppt` format. All of them are within the **Converted-ppt** directory.
